The author, Winston S. Sirug, is an associate professor at San Sebastian College-Recoletos in Manila, Philippines. He has a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Management from De La Salle University and has published several papers and books on operations research and management science. He has also conducted trainings and consultancies for various organizations in the Philippines and abroad.
 
The book is divided into 12 chapters, each with its own learning objectives, key terms, summary, review questions, and problems. The first chapter introduces the concepts and scope of operations research and management science, as well as the steps involved in solving problems using these methods. The second chapter discusses the graphical and algebraic methods of solving linear programming problems, as well as the simplex method and its variations. The third chapter explains how to model and solve transportation, assignment, and transshipment problems using linear programming. The fourth chapter deals with network analysis techniques such as shortest path, minimum spanning tree, maximum flow, and minimum cost flow problems.
 
The fifth chapter covers inventory management models such as economic order quantity, reorder point, safety stock, quantity discounts, and periodic review systems. The sixth chapter introduces queuing theory and its applications in analyzing service systems such as banks, hospitals, supermarkets, and call centers. The seventh chapter presents simulation as a tool for modeling complex and uncertain systems such as inventory systems, queuing systems, and manufacturing systems. The eighth chapter describes decision analysis methods such as decision trees, payoff tables, expected value, expected utility, sensitivity analysis, and risk analysis.
 
The ninth chapter focuses on project management techniques such as network diagrams, critical path method, program evaluation and review technique, crashing, resource leveling, and earned value management. The tenth chapter explores game theory and its applications in competitive situations such as pricing strategies, bidding strategies, and bargaining strategies. The eleventh chapter discusses forecasting methods such as time series analysis, regression analysis, exponential smoothing, moving averages, trend analysis, and seasonal adjustment. The twelfth chapter reviews some of the advanced topics in operations research and management science such as nonlinear programming, integer programming, goal programming, dynamic programming, and Markov chains.
 
**Basic Quantitative Methods for Business** is a well-written and well-organized book that provides a solid foundation for students and practitioners who want to learn more about operations research and management science. It is suitable for undergraduate courses in business administration, engineering, and other related fields. It is also a useful reference for managers, consultants, and researchers who want to apply quantitative methods to improve their decision making and problem solving skills.
